Still I raise:

I always loved to spend my time with nature,
Everything was alright when I was a teenager,
And then I've got thrown into a place,
Where I got to raise my dull glaive,
To survive the ward, not with the world,
But within me, I feel lost, now I'm cold,
Colder than the ice sheet, wandered around & lost,
I'm yearning for a gentle warmth, what will it cost?
Just before I was nearing my end, my lords of saviors appears,
And they told me that you only live once, now live yours,
Till this day I'm grateful to them, they are the reason,
for me to keep moving, they are the ones who pray on,
my success and for them I raise from my pit of desparir,
eventhough I've been down so many times, still I raise to repair,
My older self...
