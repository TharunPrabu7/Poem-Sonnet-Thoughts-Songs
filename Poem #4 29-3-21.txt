Move on:

It feels like yesterday, we've held our hands & walked,
It didn't fade away, all the silly things that we've talked...
I don't think that it will happen again,
The moments we've shared, the memories with you, I should refrain...
It's been way too long, since I felt your sweet touch,
After all the time, you've changed so much...
In a way that i've lost the girl I once loved,
After all these trouble we went through, and
You've choose to change, yet I'm here waiting for you,
I've been hurt, again & again, now my heart is blue...
I am done waiting, it's time to move on,
But those memories of us together won't be gone...
I'll learn to live without you, not that its easy,
Until I do I'll be keeping my mind busy...
I hope my mind, heart & body can take it,
I'll move on, Definitely I'll make it through...
