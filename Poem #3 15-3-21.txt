Longing:

It happens at a random time,
Our memories with eachother were sublime...
Suddenly everything reminds me fo you,
My feelings for you were true...
Thinking back, I was happy,
Eventhough I've always been sappy...
Me with you, every damn thing went fine,
And I desperately wan to make you mine...
Or so, I thought you felt the same,
And it's a shame that, I'm now a person,
Deprived of his emotions,
Longing to get back what he once had...
