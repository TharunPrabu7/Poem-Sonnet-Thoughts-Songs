Sometimes you'll be forced to make a choice. 
That might be the end of something inside you.
Deep down, You've always wanted to change,
Unfortunatelyl, You can't do shit cause, what's done is done.
So, Instead of cursing and blaming yourself, 
You should learn self love. 
You have to love yourself, so that you become worthy of loving others.
It is okay to suck, Everyone has flaws in them.
That's what make us human. Instead of waiting for a change,
you can bring yourself the change you want. Start now!
