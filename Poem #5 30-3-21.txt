Try, I guess:

Sometimes I want to know why,
I can't seem to try,
And I'm comfortable with that,
May be I was acting like a brat,
I don't care whatever people say,
I'll do the things my way,
They don't seem to understand,
On my social life, where I stand,
I just want to live without any care,
Maybe in the late future, I'll go somewhere,
Where I can be alone with myself,
My heart is already beaten into a pulp,
I want to stand on my own,
I'll write those thoughts into my bone,
I think I'll just have to try,
to change myself into a future self,
where I don't cry...
