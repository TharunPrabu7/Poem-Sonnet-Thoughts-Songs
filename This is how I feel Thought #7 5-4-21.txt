This is How I feel:

Sometimes I feel like, the more I love a person,
the more afraid I get, when I think of losing them,
So I'll start to act in a weird way, where
I don't want them to think of me as annoying,
I'm doing it because I want to make our relationship sustain,
May be I've experienced this kind of stuff recently,
Cuz, the older me was so brave about socializing,
It feels like I'm slowly fading away, from being brave
to a coward with a ton of anxiety in his head,
One thing I'm sure of is that I shouldn't act this way
And the other thing is that I don't know how to
I feel like maybe people around me are starting to hate me
So at times I wish to be alone, me and my thoughts
I've been there & I've come through and again I'm in here
All I wish is that atleast this time, I want to break free
from the shackles of my anxiety about losing myself,
losing the people I love, losing the future I'm yearning for,
I want to walk beside you, I'm not asking for your help
I'll do it by myself so that I won't end up in the same pit again,
I love you and Thank you for being with me during my hard times...
