Hope:

Not everyday is going to be a good one,
Someday you will end up breaking yourself
Or someday you will enjoy yourself to utmost,
Either way, the next day is destined to come,
Whether you like it or not,
What thrives you to move forward?
Or what's holding you back?
Is it the goal that you have to reach?
Or the thing you don't wanna speak?
Is it the time that binds you?
Or is it the "Hope" that makes you pursuit,
Another day to survive...
