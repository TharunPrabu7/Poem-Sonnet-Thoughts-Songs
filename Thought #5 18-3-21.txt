My Destiny:

Am I doing everything I can?
Am I getting everything I want?
I wish for some certain things,
But I end up getting far way from it,
Into the void, alone in the darkness,
Is this my destiny?
Am I destined to be like this?
I'm starting to question my own existence,
I have a goal, a destiny in my mind,
Is it worth sweating for?
Guess, You don't know unless you try...
