THINKING BACK:

I wish to get back what I had,
I'm being selfish, cause I'm mad...
Both of us have changed,
That thought makes me deranged...
Won't I have a chance?
To make our state advance...
Is it worth going back?
To be on the same track...
Thoughts of future fears me,
Thoughts of past depresses me,
I don't know what to do,
I hope you'll think this through, My dear one...
