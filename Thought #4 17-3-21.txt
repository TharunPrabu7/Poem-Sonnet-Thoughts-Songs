Days goes by:

The day I left her,
I didn't feel anything at all.
But, As days goes by,
All the light begins to dim
As if I'm the only one that got stuck in an eclipse.
My light is fading away,
while yours is getting brighter day by day,
I feel like I'm getting lost
And the one thing that keeps me sane is you,
The light in my absolute darkness.
But, I can't seem to grab a hold of you.
So, can you atleast say those magic words,
And dispel this veil of dark emotions on me,
I need to find you, Cause I miss you more day by day.
