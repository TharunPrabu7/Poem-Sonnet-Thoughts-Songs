When you find love:

The day you find love,
It might not be a special one,
It might happen on a random day, at a random time.
But, when it happens,
You will get a feeling that,
I've gotta talk to this girl,
I've gotta tell my friends & family about this one.
Eventhough, she's just an ordinary one
It will hit different,
Different from what you feel towards others,
You'll be having the urge to hold her in your arms,
See her eye to eye and ask her hands in marriage,
And when you feel that, Congrats
You've succeeded in finding the one,
And that's love, ladies & gentle men.
