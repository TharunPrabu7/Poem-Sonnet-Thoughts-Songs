With you:

How many times have I been struck down?
It's been too many times that I've lost my count
Someone give me some confidence to mount,
In my heart, to move apart from her.

How many times I've been longing for her?
At any time, she's not for me there
I've been wondering myself where,
this life takes me, throws me, around.

Is it something wrong with me,
I just want to be free,
There's a lot I've been yearning for,
And the first thing is to be free,

I just want to be free, be free, be free,
I just want to be in your arms, your arms, your arms,

I just want to be free with you,
I just want to be free with you,
I just want to be free with you,

Things happened when we weren't together,
I do believe that it don't matter.
Can you just take me somewhere further?
to a place, where no one's there, with you.

Am I right to tink that I deserve you
My love for you is always been true
Can you please make the move first, cause
I'm in this hole, it's too dark, without you.

I know we've not been talking much
And I've been thinking low about me as such,
I've been trying so hard, I'm about to burst
I'm losing my trust, I'm at my worst, without you.

I just want to be free, be free, be free,
I just want to be in your arms, your arms, your arms,

I just want to be free with you,
I just want to be free with you,
I just want to be free with you,

So will you take my hand,
and venture far behind,
Will you come with me,
Like the past, can we be?

I just want to be free with you...
